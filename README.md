# What is this?
An analysis on hate crimes reported in the US from 1991 to 2020

### How agencies report hate crimes:
> "Hate crimes are motivated, in whole or in part, by the offender’s bias against a race, gender, gender identity, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity, and were committed against people, property, or society. Because motivation is subjective, it is sometimes difficult to know with certainty whether a crime resulted from the offender’s bias. The presence of bias alone does not necessarily mean that a crime can be considered a hate crime. Only when a law enforcement investigation reveals sufficient evidence to lead a reasonable and prudent person to conclude that the offender’s actions were motivated, in whole or in part, by their bias, should an agency report an incident as a hate crime."

### Types of incidents:
> "The FBI collects data about both **single-bias** and **multiple-bias** hate crimes. A single-bias incident includes one or more offenses that were motivated by the same bias. Beginning in 2013, law enforcement agencies could report up to five bias motivations per offense type. Therefore, the definition of a multiple-bias incident has been revised to an incident in which one or more offenses were motivated by two or more biases. For the years prior to 2013, a multiple-bias incident was defined as an incident in which more than one offense type occurred and at least two offense types were motivated by a different bias."
